# Access your AWS resources through Javascript
This is an overview of how you can config and access your AWS resources through code. Mainly this will focus on the the S3 services within the AWS ambrella of services and more to be added in the future.

The AWS_SDK for Javascript is being used to leverage the easy of use.

#Dependencies
1. AWS-SDK
2. Express
3. Node

Please note I used Express to create the endpoints but you can use a library/framework of your own.

#Installation
First install Node from https://nodejs.org and select package depending on the Operationg System you are running on your machine.
Installing Node will install both the runtime as well as the Node package manager by default, so you do not have to go install the pkg manager. Isn't that cool :).

AWS-SDK
In your terminal run the following command:
npm install aws-sdk

Express
In your terminal run the following command:
npm install express
